# Graphite Docs Android
> The Graphite Android App

Graphite is a decentralized and encrypted alternative to Google's G-Suite, built on [Blockstack](http://blockstack.org). The app never stores your identity or any of your data. You own your files, you choose what to share.

## Installation

OS X & Linux:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Graphite-Docs/graphite-android.git
```

Windows:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Graphite-Docs/graphite-android.git
```

1. [Install Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
2. `cd` into the project repo
3. Import the project. Open Android Studio, click `Open an existing Android
   Studio project` and select the project. Gradle will build the project.
4. Run the app. Click `Run > Run 'app'`. After the project builds you'll be
   prompted to build or launch an emulator.

## Motivation

This project stemmed from the increasing control companies place on user data. At any given moment, Google can remove access to every single one of the documents you write and store with them. That's unacceptable.

Additionally, government censorship, which has always been around, seems to be growing more prevalent.

Graphite sets out to change that, and this was only possible because of the work done by Blockstack.
